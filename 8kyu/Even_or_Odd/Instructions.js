// Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

// So just to make sure that we only want numbers either even or odd? 
// Are there any constraints? 
// Will there only be numbers that are inputted?
