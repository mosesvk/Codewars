/// Additional Q's

// HTML/CSS: 
// Describe the box-model in HTML/CSS.
// => essentially a box will always wrap around every HTML element. 
//    that box consists of margins, borders, padding, and the content element itself.

// JavaScript: 
// What does hoisting refer to, and how does it work in JavaScript?
// ==> this is JS's behavior of having DECLARATIONS in the top
//     Remember to ALWAYS declare all variables at the top of the scope 
//     This is good practice as it will help avoid any bugs.

// React: 
// What is setState and what does it do?
//  ==> adds changes to the component's state and tells React that this component 
//      and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state.
