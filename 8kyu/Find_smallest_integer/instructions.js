// Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

// For example:

// Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
// Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
// You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

//Hint either use a for loop OR much shorter, use .Math function(Won't tell you which one though)

class SmallestIntegerFinder {
  findSmallestInt(args) {
    // code here
    // use an array method to find the smallest number in the array.
    
  }
}

//step 1: ask clarifying questions
//step 2: function signature -> function(args) => number
//step 3: sample data, 
//step 4: pseudo code (step by step of what you will be doing)
