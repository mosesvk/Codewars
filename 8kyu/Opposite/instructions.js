//Look Below for hints 

//step 1: ask clarifying questions
//step 2: function signature -> function(number) => number
//step 3: sample data, what the function will take as an argument, and what it is expected to return with that argument
//step 4: pseudo code (step by step of what you will be doing)
//  write a function called opposite that takes a number parameter
//  multiply that parameter by -1
