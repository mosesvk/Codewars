// Trolls are attacking your comment section!

// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

const disemvowel = str => {
  //Code here
}

// step 1: initialize a variable to each vowel using the regexp and modifier that is case Insensitive. 
// step 2: use a method that returns a new string with all or some matches of a pattern that is replaced
// step 3: in that method we will be passing the variable from the first step, and an empty string that will take away the vowel from the string.
